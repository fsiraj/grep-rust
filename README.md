This is a Rust solution to the ["Build Your Own grep" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/grep/overview).

[Regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) (Regexes, for short) are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. [`grep`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep) is a CLI tool for searching using Regexes.

1. Ensure you have `cargo (1.87)` installed locally
1. Run `./grep.sh` to run the program, which is implemented in `src/main.rs`. This command compiles the Rust project, so it might be slow the first time you run it. Subsequent runs will be fast.
1. Commit changes and run `git push origin master` to submit to CodeCrafters. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.
1. Alternatively, run an extended test suite locally with `cargo test`.
